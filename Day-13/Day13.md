## WEB-DEV:
Today we will apply everything that we have learnt, and try to make a Coin Toss game in 
three steps.

1.	Generate a random number with Math.random(). Save it in a variable. 
2.	Create an if-statement and check: If the number is less than 0.5, then save the result 
in a variable called 'result'.
3.	Let's say we're trying to guess the result. Create a variable called 'guess' and save 
your guess ('heads' or 'tails'). 
If your guess matches the result, display 'You win!' in the console
If your guess does not match the result, display 'You lose!'

You can make it visually appealing by using your own creativity
