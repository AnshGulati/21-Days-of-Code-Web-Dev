## WEB-DEV:
Today, we aim to explore the necessity and function of databases. Given that many of us will be setting up MySQL, we'll focus on foundational questions.

### Tasks:
1. Create a database named ACM21DOC.
2. Create a table named STUDENTS as followed: [ Name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, Bdate DATE, Sex CHAR]
3. Input some dummy entry and use SELECT * FROM STUDENTS to display all the entry. Submit all the queries performed in a .txt file
