## WEB-DEV:


1.	Create a React component called ButtonClicker that displays a button. When clicked, 
the button should change its text from "Click me" to "Clicked!".
2.	Create a React component called LikeButton that displays a button labeled "Like". When 
clicked, it should increment a count displayed next to the button indicating how many times it's 
been clicked.
3.	Create a React component called TrafficLight that displays a traffic light with three 
colors: Red, Yellow, and Green. Implement a button that toggles the state of the traffic light 
(Red -> Green -> Yellow -> Red).
